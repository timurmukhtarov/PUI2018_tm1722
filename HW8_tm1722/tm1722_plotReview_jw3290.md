**Clarity**:  The plot shows clearly the difference of Hass Avocado price in 5 cities. The label on y-axis indicates the currency used in measurement. From the plot, we can easily observe the difference in 5 cities, but among them, four out of five cities have the average price in a very small range, which is from 1.2 USD to 1.4 USD. With such small difference, it is hard to get insights from the comparison.   

**Esthetic**: The plot includes title and caption, making it easy to read and understand. The size of the labels and the bar chart is also set up well. 

**Honesty**: This plot divides the y-axis equally and starts from zero. Because it just shows the average price of Hass Avocado in five cities, it does not make any distortion and adjustment to the data. The plot is honest to reproduce the result.
