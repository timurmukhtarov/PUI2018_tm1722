HW 12

Did all of the HW together with Mark Bauer, Manrique Vargas, Alia Kassem, Sarah Aita. 
Katie Voorhees helped us with the for loop to make graphs in Assignment 2. Thanks, Katie! 


**Assignment 1.** 

Here, we needed to find periodicity with Fourier Transforms in the time series from [HW11] and discuss what are the most significant periods.


**Assignment 2.**

Here, we needed to do clustering on zipcodes based on the economic development (business counts) in time for 1993-2006.
